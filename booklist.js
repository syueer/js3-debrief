// BookManager class
// We are creating a class that will manage a list of books. Each time we add a book, we want our new book to be added to a list with a unique, incremented id.
// Let's try to code this down below!
class BookManager {
  // this is a constructor with a paramater currentId set to 0 by default
  constructor(currentId = 0) {
    // 1. initialize an empty array called books

    // 2. initialize a currentId set to currentId
  }

  // 3. a getter function should return the value of our books array
  get books() {

  }

  // function addBook should create an object and push it to our books array
  // it should take in a name, genre and author and by default have an empty string
  addBook() {
    // 4. Create an object assigned to a variable for the new book using parameters given to addBook

    // a) your object should consist of properties id, name,genre and author with values added when we call this method
    // don't forget that this may require some parameters to be used as values
    // b) id should be unique and increment by 1 every new instance
    // c) if no argument is given, the properties should equal an empty string

    // 5. Push the newly created object to our books array
    // hint: note that best practice would be to access our books array using the get method

  }

}

// 6. outside the class, create an instance of BookManager

// 7. add two books with the following properties to our instance
// "The Alchemist", "Life", "Paulo Coelho"
// "Time to Play", "Children's Book", "Bluey"

// 8. console log our books array to check that the new books were added
